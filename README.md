## Status of the Project

#### What Works
 
* Players can be declared in the main.py file
* Initial Cards, Communnity cards - Flop cards, Turn card, River card will be automatically fetched from the deck using random shuffle module.
* I created 10 validators in 10 python file, and called by importing it from the __init__.py file
* Winners is calculated by who is having the best combination of cards.

This created with Python !

####  Future Work

* Anyone can branch out and make it more interactive and send me pull request
